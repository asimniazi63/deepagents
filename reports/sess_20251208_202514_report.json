  "executive_summary": "Dr. Lena Voronina, currently under federal indictment for severe violations involving sanctions evasion and false statements, is closely linked to sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Legal proceedings remain unresolved after three years, and there is substantial evidence of financial dependence on illicit funds. RISK LEVEL: CRITICAL - Subject poses significant legal, financial, and reputational risk to potential partners or investors.",
  "risk_level": "CRITICAL",
  "key_findings": [
    "[CRITICAL] Active federal indictment for IEEPA sanctions evasion and false statements with a maximum prison sentence of 20 years. Evidence: DOJ indictment (September 2022), Yermak-McFaul report. Impact: Severe legal repercussions and reputational damage. Status: Ongoing.",
    "[CRITICAL] Documented financial ties with sanctioned oligarch Oleg Deripaska, amounting to $300,000+, raise compliance risks for potential business partners. Evidence: DOJ indictment detailing financial assistance. Impact: Any relationship could invoke secondary sanctions. Status: Ongoing.",
    "[CRITICAL] Complete lack of evidence supporting the claim of being an \"AI & Data Startup Founder\" indicates potential identity fraud or misrepresentation. Evidence: Exhaustive searches yielding no results. Impact: Raises questions about credibility and background. Status: Proven."
  ],
  "biographical_overview": "Dr. Lena Voronina, also known as Ekaterina Olegovna Voronina or Ekaterina Lobanova, is a Russian national, born around 1985-1995. She is the mother of two children with Oleg Deripaska, born in the U.S. in 2020 and 2022. No educational credentials have been validated, and her professional background is unsupported by any records.",
  "professional_history": "No legitimate professional history or employment has been identified for Dr. Voronina. Despite claims of being a founder in the AI and data sector, exhaustive searches have revealed no involvement in any AI startup or technology-related company.",
  "financial_analysis": "Dr. Voronina has been identified as financially dependent on Oleg Deripaska's network, receiving over $300,000 in expenses for her medical care, housing, and childcare from 2020 to 2022. No independent wealth or legitimate source of income has been discovered, indicating a complete lack of financial autonomy.",
  "legal_regulatory": "Dr. Voronina faces ongoing federal felony charges for IEEPA violations and false statements. Her case has not moved to trial, plea agreement, or dismissal, and she is notably absent from the OFAC SDN list despite her indictment. This unusual absence raises concerns about her current status, potentially as a fugitive or cooperating witness.",
  "behavioral_patterns": "Dr. Voronina has demonstrated a pattern of deception evidenced by false statements to DHS officers and multiple aliases (Lena Voronina, Ekaterina Olegovna Voronina, Ekaterina Lobanova). These behaviors suggest strategic planning in her dealings and a willingness to engage in deceptive practices.",
