The company has faced a substantial decline in advertising revenue, a decrease in valuation, and concerns regarding its debt servicing capabilities.\n\n**Revenue Decline and Advertiser Exodus:**\n\n- **Advertising Revenue:** In 2023, X Corp's advertising revenue was approximately $2.5 billion, a 54% decline from 2022's $4.5 billion. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/ac2cb6419d93d64086cc9ad980c5a57a?utm_source=openai)) This downward trend continued into 2024, with projections estimating ad revenue at $2.5 billion, marking a 50% drop from prior years.

([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/ac2cb6419d93d64086cc9ad980c5a57a?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Financial Performance and Debt Service:**\n\n- **Valuation Decline:** Fidelity reported a 72% decrease in X Corp's valuation, dropping from $20 billion to $5.6 billion as of October 2023. ([fortune.com](https://fortune.com/2024/01/02/elon-musk-twitter-value-72-percent-drop-fidelity/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Debt Load:** X Corp carries a $12 billion debt from Musk's acquisition, with annual interest payments estimated between $600 million and $800 million. ([x.com](https://x.com/i/grok/share/7ouvMrtGLXYiVz0SslIOqKJO7?utm_source=openai)) Despite efforts to diversify revenue streams, the company remains unprofitable due to high debt servicing costs and operating expenses exceeding revenue.\n\n**Bankruptcy Risk:**\n\nWhile X Corp has not publicly disclosed bankruptcy plans, its financial trajectory raises concerns. The substantial debt burden, declining revenue, and reduced valuation suggest potential liquidity challenges. However, the company's strategic initiatives, such as the merger with xAI, aim to leverage synergies between AI development and data distribution, potentially enhancing financial stability.

She also claims that SpaceX allowed her supervisor to transfer $3.7 million in stock options to evade child support payments.

The letter, circulated in June 2022, called for executive accountability and described Musk\u2019s public behavior as a distraction and embarrassment. Nine employees were reportedly terminated for their involvement, though only eight are included in the complaint.
