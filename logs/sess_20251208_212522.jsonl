After his father's death in 1983, he and his mother relocated to Los Angeles, where he worked night shifts at McDonald's to support his family and fund his education.

He later worked at Peregrine Investments Holdings, where he met billionaire hedge fund manager Julian Robertson. Robertson, impressed by Hwang's expertise, brought him into his firm, Tiger Management. After Tiger Management closed in 2000, Robertson provided Hwang with approximately $25 million to start his own hedge fund, Tiger Asia Management, which grew to over $5 billion at its peak.

Archegos employed highly leveraged positions in total return swaps, allowing it to amass large, concentrated holdings in companies like ViacomCBS, Baidu, and Farfetch without public disclosure.

([fia.org](https://www.fia.org/sites/default/files/2022-03/The%20Archegos%20Rules%20Distribution%20030322.pdf?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Protect Compliance Officers**: Enact Rule 15Fh-4(c) to shield chief compliance officers from undue influence or coercion. ([fia.org](https://www.fia.org/sites/default/files/2022-03/The%20Archegos%20Rules%20Distribution%20030322.pdf?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Enhance Position Reporting**: Introduce Rule 10B-1, requiring prompt disclosure of large security-based swap positions exceeding specified thresholds. ([fia.org](https://www.fia.org/sites/default/files/2022-03/The%20Archegos%20Rules%20Distribution%20030322.pdf?utm_source=openai))\n\nSpecifically, Rule 10B-1 proposed that investors disclose swap positions within one business day if they exceeded $300 million or 5% of a company's outstanding equity securities. This measure aimed to prevent market manipulation and insider trading. ([daypitney.com](https://www.daypitney.com/insights/publications/2022/09/fog4-the-archegos-scandal-the-sec-responds/?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe SEC also considered reforms to family office regulations. Historically, family offices were exempt from certain SEC regulations, including registration as investment advisers. The Archegos incident prompted discussions about potentially removing this exemption to subject family offices to enhanced reporting requirements, thereby increasing regulatory oversight. ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF11825?utm_source=openai))\n\nAs of December 2025, the SEC has not finalized these proposed rules. The most recent update indicates that the SEC plans to finalize two dozen rules in 2023, including those related to security-based swap reporting.
